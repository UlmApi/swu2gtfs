# swu2gtfs

This piece of.. code intends to make use of time table information provided by the Stadtwerke Ulm (SWU), which is the transport authority responsible for most of Ulm's public transit system. As of now, there is no standardized interface to get hold of said time table information, so we use the CSV exports that are created anyways for some poor person typesetting said files into pocket time tables.

I tried to comment rather liberally, but am a poor programmer, so both comments and variables are a wild mixture of German and English. I don't think this code might be of any help to anyone outside Ulm anyways, but whatever.

## usage

Run it in java and provide a path to a directory filled to the brim with SWU's time table CSV files (and nothing else). Information about the route names will be expected through the file name. More documentation about the table layout, naming conventions and so on is available in the transport section of the ulmapi.de wiki system.

## what it does

You'll end up with two files: trips.txt and stop_times.txt. Both should be valid GTFS files.

## what it doesn't

You will still need to provide the rest of all the neccessary files: 

* agency.txt and routes.txt: Shouldn't be a problem 
* stops.txt: Can be extracted from the KMZ files provided on ulmapi.de
* calendar.txt: Is pretty static. Right now, "0" is weekdays, "2" saturdays and "3" sundays. The rest of the schedule (Ss, Sf, Fa, etc.) goes according to the plain text notes in the CSV files. Refer to ulmapi.de as to what they mean.
* frequencies.txt: Requires manual work: Compare the CSV to the printed schedule, delete the recurring trips before parsing and manually insert according entries into frequencies.txt
* calendar_dates.txt: This one is tricky -- i.e., right now, it will take manual work.
* shapes.txt: This one is even trickier and should be automated. No idea right now as to how that would work

## wishlist
* automatic recognition of recurring trips and managing those into frequencies.txt
* automatic recognition/classing of identical trips and requesting shapefiles for shapes.txt
* some way of parsing SWU's (different) calendar classification for calendar_dates.txt
